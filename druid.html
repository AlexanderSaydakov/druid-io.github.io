    <h1 id="whatis">What is Druid?</h1>
    <h3>Druid is an analytics data store built to allow fast (“real-time”) access to large sets of read-oriented data.</h3>
    <h2 id="realtime">Real Time Ingestion</h2>
    <p><span>Real time query.</span> Typical analytics databases ingest data via batch processing; while the ingestion to query latency this is low for smaller data sets, Druid's real time nodes allow querying against multiple very large data sets while they are streaming into the system.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2 id="scalable">Scalable</h2>
    <p><span>Efficient in-memory configuration.</span> While the entire database can be configured in memory, this becomes cost prohibitive considering the explosive growth of "Big Data." Druid query nodes are configurable and can be configured to be completely in-memory, only from storage or both.</p>
    <p><span>Highly Available.</span> Scaling up or down, replicating nodes, or recovering from failure typically impacts availability and performance. Druid uses a distributed architecture that allows replication at the segment level – relieving the load on "hot segments." And, because of replication, Druid supports rolling deployments and restarts. Scaling up or scale down just by adding or remove nodes; without re-indexing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2 id="hri">Human Responsive Interaction</h2>
    <p><span>Ad hoc, multi-dimensional filtering.</span> Druid uses bitmap indices with CONCISE compression to create highly dense and accurate indices allowing for an arbitrary number of filters, cost effectively and <a href="http://metamarkets.com/2012/druid-bitmap-compression/">without impact on performance.</a><br/></p>
    <p><span>Column-oriented for speed.</span> Data is laid out in columns so that scans are limited to specific data being searched. <a href="http://metamarkets.com/2011/druid-part-deux-three-principles-for-fast-distributed-olap/">Compression decreases overall data footprint.</a></p>
    <p><span>Seamless query against real-time and historical data.</span>Druid automates the migration of real-time data to historical query nodes as the data ages. This allows querying against both real-time and vast amounts of historical data in a single query.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h1 id="where">Where did Druid Come From?</h1>
    <p>Druid was created out of necessity by Metamarkets, a company focused on providing real-time interactive insight to the RTB (real time bidding) AdTech space with a full stack analytics service.  It’s thesis was to create a read oriented database that could query while ingesting data, provide ad-hoc N-dimensional drill down and still provide sub-second responses. Stretching it further, the system was designed to scale without downtime, and utilize cloud resources cost efficiently.</p>
    <p>Druid was <a href="http://metamarkets.com/2012/metamarkets-open-sources-druid/">open-sourced</a> to help raise awareness for true real-time interactive analytics among all the "big-data" incumbents.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h1 id="used">What is Druid Used For?</h1>
    <p>Druid is a purpose built database that provides deep exploratory insight against very large quantities of data as its being streamed or ingested into the system.  It's useful for immediate insight for lots of streaming data and/or ad hoc n-dimensional filtering.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2>Immediate insight to large quantities of data:</h2>
    <p>The low time latency between when data is ingested into Druid and when that data is available for query allows users to develop insight very close to actual events producing that data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2>Deep, exploratory drill-down:</h2>
    <p>Users value the ability to create many arbitrary filter dimensions without impacting performance, breaking scalability or cost viability (compute infrastructure). Ad hoc drill down on immediate and historical data allows users to query both "fresh", or immediately ingested data and historical data all at once.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h1 id="whois">Who is using Druid?</h1>
    <h2>Metamarkets</h2>
    <p>Druid is the primary data store for Metamarkets’ full stack visual analytics service for the RTB (real time bidding) space. Pulling in over xx billion records per day, Metamarkets is able to provide insight to its customers with complex ad-hoc queries with an average query time of less than 400 milliseconds.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2>Netflix</h2>
    <p>Netflix engineers use Druid to aggregate multiple data streams, ingesting up to two terabytes per hour, with the ability to query data as its being ingested. They use Druid to pinpoint anomalies within their infrastructure, endpoint activity and content flow.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2>R-users</h2>
    <p>The R community leverages Druid for research on extremely large data sets;  the ability of being able to return complex query drill downs in seconds oppose to hours helps Data Scientists be more efficient and effective. To make it even easier, Metamarkets recently open sourced <a href="https://github.com/metamx/RDruid">the Druid-R connector</a>.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="text-item indent">
    <h2>Virtustream</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.virtustream.com/company/buzz/press_releases/big_data_cloud">Virtustream</a>, an Enterprise Class Cloud provider, offers secure highly available, flexible, infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform, uses Druid as a real-time analytics service offering for their customers.</p>
