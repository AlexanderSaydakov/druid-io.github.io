## Contribute

Druid has a growing list open source projects and we’re delighted to work with
outside engineers on everything from fixes, new connectors, and core projects.
Of course, there are more ways to contribute than writing code, feature
suggestions, reporting bugs, [documentation](documentation.html) and usability
feedback all matter immensely. You can learn more about contributing by
visiting our wiki maintained on our [Github page](https://github.com/metamx/druid/wiki).
In case you’re curious, our contributor’s license agreement is embedded in our
submission process and must be accepted before your Github pull request can be
merged.
