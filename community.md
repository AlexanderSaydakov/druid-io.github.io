## Contribute

We intend for Druid to be a community-led project and weâ€™re delighted to work with
outside engineers on everything from fixes, new connectors, and core projects.

Of course, there are more ways to contribute than writing code, feature
suggestions, reporting bugs, [documentation](documentation.html) and usability
feedback all matter immensely. You can learn more about contributing by
visiting our [Github wiki](https://github.com/metamx/druid/wiki).

For code contributions, we do require that a contributor's license agreement (CLA) is agreed to before we can accept the code.  Our CLA is fashioned after the Apache CLA and can be found in the base directory in the source code at https://github.com/metamx/druid
