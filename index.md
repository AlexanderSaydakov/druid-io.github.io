|||Druid is open source infrastructure for Real&sup2;time Exploratory Analytics Layers. The system uses a distributed, shared-nothing architecture designed for real-time data ingestion. It leverages column-orientation and advanced indexing structures to allow for the arbitrary exploration of billion-row tables with sub-second latencies.
