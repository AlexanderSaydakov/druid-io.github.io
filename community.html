      <h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
      <p>We intend for Druid to be a community-led project and weâ€™re delighted to work with engineers everywhere on everything from fixes, new connectors, and core projects.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are more ways to contribute than writing code; feature suggestions, reporting bugs, <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a> and usability feedback all matter immensely. If you have any questions or concerns around contributions, please direct them at the google group listed above.</p>
      <p>For code contributions, we do require that a contributor&#8217;s license agreement (CLA) is agreed to before we can accept the code. Our CLA is fashioned after the Apache CLA and can be found in the base directory of our <a href="https://github.com/metamx/druid/">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
      <p>We ask that if you do contribute major new functionality or major changes to current functionality to please also include some tests and also make the corresponding changes to relevant docs. This helps us maintain the code base for everyone.</p>
