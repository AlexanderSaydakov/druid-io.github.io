We recently attended [Stanford XLDB](http://www.xldb.org/) and it was a blast. Once a year, XLDB invites speakers from different organizations to discuss the challenges of and solutions to dealing with Xtreme (with an X!) data sets. This year, Jeff Dean dropped knowledge bombs about architecting scalable systems, Michael Stonebraker provided inspiring advice about growing an open source data store, the guys from CERN explained the data-related challenges of finding the Higg's Boson, and several well known technology companies shared details about what they were up to. We totally recommend checking out the [slides](https://conf-slac.stanford.edu/xldb-2013/conference-program) from the conference.

We attended XLDB to teach our very first Druid tutorial session. Battling an alarm clock that went off far to early (for engineers anyway) and braving the insanity that is highway 101 morning traffic, most of us almost managed to show up on time for our session.

The focus of our tutorial is to teach people why we built Druid, how druid is architected, and how to build applications on top of Druid. Check out our slides below:

We are constantly trying improve the process around educating people about Druid. In the future, we hope to refine and repeat this talk at other cool conferences.
