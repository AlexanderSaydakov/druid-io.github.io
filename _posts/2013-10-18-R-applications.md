In this post, we'll look at building Druid Applications in the [R language](http://www.r-project.org/). RDruid is a Druid library for R, available here: [https://github.com/metamx/RDruid](https://github.com/metamx/RDruid) To install RDruid, simply run these commands in R:

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("RDruid", "metamx")
