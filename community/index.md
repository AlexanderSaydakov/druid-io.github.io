## Contribute

We intend for Druid to be a community-led project and we are delighted to
work with engineers everywhere on everything from fixes, new connectors, and
core projects.

Of course, there are more ways to contribute than writing code; feature
suggestions, reporting bugs, [documentation](/documentation.html) and
usability feedback all matter immensely. If you have any questions or
concerns around contributions, please direct them at the [google
group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/druid-development).

For code contributions, we require that you agree to a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA) before we can accept the code. You can find our CLA on and
sign it directly on our [CLA page](/community/cla.html)

We ask that if you do contribute major new functionality or major changes to
current functionality to please follow our [contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
This helps us maintain the code base for everyone.
