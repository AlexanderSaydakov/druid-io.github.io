## Contributing

Druid is a community-led project and we are delighted to receive contributions
of anything from minor fixes to big new features.

### Committers

Committers are collectively responsible for Druid's technical management. This involves
setting the direction of the project, contributing code, and reviewing code contributed
by others.

### What to work on

If you have an itch to scratch, then by all means do that! Fixing bugs you run
into, or adding features you need, are both immensely helpful.

If you're looking for some starter projects, we maintain a [list of issues](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Difficulty+-+Easy%22) suitable
for new developers.

There are plenty of ways to help outside writing Druid code. Feature
suggestions, reporting bugs, [documentation](/docs/{{ site.druid_version }}/)
and usability feedback all matter immensely. Another big way to help is
through [client libraries](/docs/latest/development/libraries.html), which are
avaialble in a variety of languages. If you develop a new one, we'll be happy
to include it in the list.

### Getting your changes accepted

Patches to Druid are done through GitHub pull requests. Most pull requests
will be merged after two committers have reviewed it and given a +1. The one
exception is major architectural changes or API changes, which often warrant
additional review. For those, it can help to discuss things on the [druid-development
list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/druid-development) beforehand.

In general please follow the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
when sending in pull requests. This will help review proceed as quickly as
possible.

For code contributions, we require that you agree to a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA) before we can accept your code. You can find our CLA on and
sign it directly on our [CLA page](/community/cla.html)

### Becoming a committer

If you'd like to become a committer, that's great! Please contact one of the
existing committers for a walk through the process. Basically, what we're
looking for is an interest in ongoing contributions to Druid.

## Governance

The PMC (Project Management Committee) is responsible for the administrative
aspects of the Druid project. The responsibilities of the PMC include:

- Approving releases
- Nominating new committers
- Maintaining the project's shared resources, including the github account,
  mailing lists, websites, social media channels, etc.
- Maintaining guidelines for the project

Currently all committers are also PMC members.
