# How to Contribute

When submitting a pull request (PR), please use the following guidelines:

- Verify the webpage works by running `jekyll -w serve`
- Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for unrelated
  features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests into one pull request.
- For any documentation changes, please submit pull requests to the [main Druid repo](https://github.com/druid-io/druid-io.github.io). All Druid documentation is hosted under [https://github.com/druid-io/druid/tree/master/docs/content](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/tree/master/docs/content).
